## 📌 3. Database Structure (SQL)

```sql
-- Companies table
CREATE TABLE companies (
    company_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_name TEXT UNIQUE,
    site_code TEXT,
    address TEXT
);

-- Contacts table
CREATE TABLE contacts (
    contact_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INT REFERENCES companies(company_id),
    contact_type TEXT, -- 'Technical' or 'Commercial'
    contact_name TEXT,
    email TEXT
);

-- Certifications table
CREATE TABLE certifications (
    cert_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id INT REFERENCES companies(company_id),
    certification_body TEXT,
    issue_date DATE,
    expiry_date DATE,
    certification_grade TEXT
);
📌 4. Key SQL Queries
📊 1. What is Isoqar's market share?

SELECT 
    "Certification Body",
    COUNT(*) AS "Total Certifications",
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) AS "Market Share (%)"
FROM certifications
GROUP BY "Certification Body"
ORDER BY "Total Certifications" DESC;
📌 Insight: How dominant Isoqar is in the certification market compared to competitors.

📊 2. Potential clients for Isoqar

SELECT 
    "Company Name",
    "Certification Body"
FROM certifications
WHERE "Company Name" NOT IN (
    SELECT "Company Name" FROM certifications WHERE "Certification Body" = 'Isoqar'
);
📌 Insight: Companies that have not yet certified with Isoqar but could do so.

📊 3. RFM Analysis for Potential Clients

WITH Potential_Clients AS (
    SELECT 
        "Company Name",
        MAX("Expiry Date") AS last_certification,
        COUNT(*) AS certification_count,
        AVG(
            CASE 
                WHEN "Certification Grade" = 'AA' THEN 5
                WHEN "Certification Grade" = 'A' THEN 4
                WHEN "Certification Grade" = 'B' THEN 3
                WHEN "Certification Grade" = 'C' THEN 2
                ELSE 1
            END
        ) AS avg_certification_quality
    FROM certifications
    WHERE "Company Name" NOT IN (
        SELECT "Company Name" FROM certifications WHERE "Certification Body" = 'Isoqar'
    ) 
    GROUP BY "Company Name"
)
SELECT 
    "Company Name",
    last_certification,
    certification_count,
    avg_certification_quality,
    CASE 
        WHEN last_certification > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year' AND avg_certification_quality >= 4 THEN 'High Probability'
        WHEN last_certification BETWEEN CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 years' AND CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 year' THEN 'Medium Probability'
        ELSE 'Low Probability'
    END AS "Likelihood to Certify with Isoqar"
FROM Potential_Clients;
📌 Insight:
✅ High Probability – Companies most likely to certify with Isoqar.
✅ Medium Probability – Companies that were certified but lost certification.
✅ Low Probability – Companies with minimal certification history.

📌 5. Automation (Future Feature)
📌 What is planned?
✅ Automated scraping of certification data from the BRC website.

# BRC Certification Scraper (Future Implementation)
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

BRC_URL = "https://directory.brcgs.com/certified-companies"
response = requests.get(BRC_URL, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
📌 6. Conclusion
✅ The project is fully adapted for BRC + ISO 27001 compliance.
✅ Risk analysis of certification losses is included.
✅ A checklist enables tracking task completion.

🚀 Next Step: Begin SQL implementation + data analysis? 😊
